<h2>4swipe</h2>
This is my first effort at using <a href="http://phaser.io">Phaser.io</a> to construct a game. The concept is very simple -- just drag the corner boxes onto the corresponding colored target in the center.

<h3>Online Demo</h3>
You can play a demo online at <a href="http://vigorwebsolutions.com/4swipe/game.html">vigorwebsolutions.com/4swipe/game.html</a>.

<h3>Recommended Usage</h3>
Rather than waste a lot of time configuring this app to look/play nice with all browser shapes and sizes, I wanted to dive right into the gameplay. That being said, it runs (looks) best on mobile devices, IMO.

<h3>To Do</h3>
My next goal is to comment out the code to make it easier to understand for someone coming at it without a knowledge of Phaser.io.

After that, I'd like to clean up the score and timer functions, add some sound and explosion/animation effects to successful hits.
